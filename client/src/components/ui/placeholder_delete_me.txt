// Note: I am simplifying this to not use class-variance-authority for now to avoid extra deps if not needed, 
// but sticking to standard shadcn-like pattern is better. 
// I'll implement a simpler version without cva if cva wasn't installed. 
// Wait, I didn't install class-variance-authority or @radix-ui/react-slot.
// I should install them if I want full shadcn compatibility, or write a simpler button.
// The user asked for "ShadCN / modern UI components".
// I should probably install `class-variance-authority` and `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` (already installed).
// And `@radix-ui/react-slot`.

// Let me pause writing the button and install these deps first.
// I'll proceed with creating the directory and utils.js first.
